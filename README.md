# The-Evolution-of-CAD-CAM-Software-in-Mechanical-Engineering
Understand the history and growth of CAD/CAM in mechanical engineering and how mastering it can enhance your career in design and manufacturing.
Introduction
Few innovations in the design and manufacturing realm have made an impact as CAD/CAM software has over the decades. [Computer-Aided Design] (CAD) and Computer-Aided Manufacturing achievements have changed how products have been designed, developed, and manufactured. A little context on this software helps illustrate the evolution of an industry that grows more intelligent, more rapid and sophisticated every year.

The Origins of CAD/CAM
In the days prior to CAD, engineers and designers planned their products with manual drafting tools. All blueprints were hand drawn, which meant there was plenty of room for mistakes and not a whole lot of wiggle room for changing things up. A small breakthrough occurred somewhere in the early 1960s when CAD started to appear. The first major advances occurred along the lines of graphic user interfaces with Sketchpad, developed by Ivan Sutherland: a graphical program with some primitive object manipulation methods.
Advanced systems, where 2D modeling and digital drafting capability was introduced, soon came into existence by the 70s. CHAM stumbled along a yard or two in the wake of CAM tech to automate machine tool control via computer. CAD/CAM system started its development for aerospace and automotive industries, but were rapidly used in a variety of other industries.
